### Budget
A budget programme that sets a limit when the budget is low

### Execute:
The programme is written using Python 3 so you will get a syntax error running the demo
using Python 2 and possibly using the functions themselves. To run it:

```bash
python demo.py

Enter a list of grant requests separated by spaces: 100 80 20 
Enter the available budget: 180
The budget cap is 80
```

### Tests
```shell
py.test budget_tests.py
```
